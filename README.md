# LaboratoryOfComputationalPhysics_B
Second part of the course of Laboratory of Computational Physics 

## Target skills and knowledge: 
The didactic objective of this class is to teach main data analysis techniques and their application to solve concreate physics problems.
The lectures will review the main methods to extract information from complex physics datasets. The students will be able to gather, summarise and visualise the statistically relevant features of a dataset; furthermore they will learn how to qualitatively and critically compare theoretical predictions with the experimental data.
That knowledge will have to be exercised on practical lab tests, devoted to the analysis of datasets relevant to various scientific areas, i.e. biophysics, astronomy, high energy physics, etc.
